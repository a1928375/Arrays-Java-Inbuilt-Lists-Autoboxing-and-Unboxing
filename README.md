1. Arrays: The concepts of Array in Java.
         
2. ArrayTest:

         (1) Create a program using arrays that sorts a list of integers in descending order. Descending order is highest value to                lowest. In other words if the array had the values in it 106, 26, 81, 5, 15 your program should ultimately have an array with            106, 81, 26, 15, 5 in it. Set up the program so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard.
         
         (2) Implement the following methods - getIntegers, printArray, and sortIntegers
         
                (i) getIntegers returns an array of entered integers from keyboard
                (ii) printArray prints out the contents of the array
                (iii) sortIntegers should sort the array and return a new array containing the sorted numbers
         
         you will have to figure out how to copy the array elements from the passed array into a new array and sort them and return the          new sorted array.

3. ReferenceVsValueType: The concepts between reference type & value type in Java.

4. MinElement:

         (1) Write a method called readIntegers() with a parameter called count that represents how many integers the user needs to              enter. The method needs to read from the console until all the numbers are entered, and then return an array containing the              numbers entered. 
         
         (2) Write a method findMin() with the array as a parameter. The method needs to return the minimum value in the array. 
         
         (3) In the main() method read the count from the console and call the method readIntegers() with the count parameter. 

         (4) Then call the findMin() method passing the array returned from the call to the readIntegers() method. Finally, print the            minimum element in the array.

         (5) Tips: 
	         
                  Assume that the user will only enter numbers, never letters
	         For simplicity, create a Scanner as a static field to help with data input
